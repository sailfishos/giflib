  <title>Library for manipulating GIF format image files</title>
  <description>The giflib package contains a shared library of functions for
loading and saving GIF format image files.  It is API and ABI compatible
with libungif, the library which supported uncompressed GIFs while the
Unisys LZW patent was in effect.

Install the giflib package if you need to write programs that use GIF files.
You should also install the giflib-utils package if you need some simple
utilities to manipulate GIFs.
